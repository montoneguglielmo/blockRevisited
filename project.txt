BLOCK is an object with:
output_size
input_size
forward
block_params
state (the output of all the internal layers)
subBlockList

FUNDAMENTALBLOCKS is an object:
it can be a CNN layer or a FFW layer
must know how to reshape the input accoring to where is receiveing the input from
params
state?

blk1 :or define a layer----or load an entrie block---or load a subblock
NetworkConfig: { 'blk1':{'input':[blk23, blk44], 'output':[blk10, blk12]}}


something for visualizing the block and their connections is needed
